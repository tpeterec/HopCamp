When we went they had plenty of duck eggs and various cuts of beef and goat vacuum sealed in the deep freezer. The center meadow was perfect for stargazing but it gets a little damp with few so make sure to bring your boots. Near the entrance of the farm there is a family trout fishing farm. We didn’t catch anything(my 3yo daughter was more interested in casting and then reeling it in immediately haha) They gave us a free return ticket to use within 30 days. If you are planning to go, I would do it on the first day so that you can come back if you don’t catch anything. Most of all we just enjoyed hanging out under the beautiful redwoods.

We stayed in mid-April so it was cold at sunset. We layered up and wore beanies while we slept. But it was still super fun! We would definitely recommend to friends and would love to stay there again. There are an abundance of plants that surround the campsite that you should not touch, some type of nettle—so beware. Also, we got lost trying to find the campsites and had to turn around several times. Best advice—for Creekside campsites set your GPS directions from your starting point to take you to the BODEGA post office (Not Bodega Bay—no cell service in the Bodega area which added to our confusion.) Once you get to the post office, Salmon Creek road is directly across the street. Follow the Host’s written directions from there. Just after you cross the bridge there will be a gate on the left side for the 3 Creekside campsites. There is only one porta-potty for all three sites but it was clean and there was no smell.
